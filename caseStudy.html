            <p class="case-text">From our research, we found that there were no apps or platforms that were
                specifically for freelancers or indie developers to collaborate with others on creative projects.
              For these individuals that start their own projects, it is often a labor of love that that is difficult to do alone, requiring long periods of commitment 
                and a variety of skills to finish.

                    We conducted our user testing with participants that fit within our domain over Discord. Our plan was to test for any heuristic violations and confirm our design decisions from qualitative data.
